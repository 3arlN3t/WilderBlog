# WilderBlog

Current Build Status: [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/58roluat93x105o5?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/shawnwildermuth/wilderblog)

I re-wrote my blog using a new stack of web technologies including:

 - ASP.NET Core 1.0 RC1
 - Entity Framework Core 1.0 RC1
 - Angular 2 Beta
 - Bootstrap 4 Alpha
 - Azure Websites and Azure Blob Storage
 
The project wasn't build to be a blog engine or a easy to re-use for your own blog. It doesn't mean you can't use it for that. Feel free to fork the project, but that wasn't a design goal. 

The current project is built with many pre-release technologies so that the code-base will change a lot as these technologies get closer to release. 

See my blog entry (and the live site) for more information on how and why I built it:
